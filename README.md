This Github repository contains script and preliminary html reports from analysis of bulk RNA-seq samples obtained from mouse heart and liver across two sampling points. The sequence of scripts needed to be executed are in numerical order (01,02 and so on). 

Scripts for running nf-core rnaseq including setting up conda environment can be found here https://github.com/adityamiyer-personal/Bulk-RNA-seq-analysis/blob/main/scripts/01_running_nfcoreRNAseq_pipeline.qmd 

The HTML version of the above script can be found here https://github.com/adityamiyer-personal/Bulk-RNA-seq-analysis/blob/main/scripts/01_running_nfcoreRNAseq_pipeline.html . Kallisto outputs were provided despite the QC tools not working properly.

**To mimic the similar design of the study, I had earlier processed the count matrix from Mansingh et al, 2024 to perform DGE (differential gene expression) and pathway-analysis along with other exploratory analysis using the count matrix. The count matrix is available for download here https://github.com/adityamiyer-personal/Bulk-RNA-seq-analysis/blob/main/scripts/Mansingh2024_expression_matrix.txt.**
